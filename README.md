Sudoku Solver

Just a practice assignment to create a sudoku puzzle solver.
I did not include 3x3 grid checking, so it is incomplete.

I. Overview:
=========
Create a sudoku solver.
The user will give us completed Sudoku puzzle solutions to have you determine which ones
are correct, and which are invalid. For a Sudoku solution to be correct, every row, column, and 3x3
subgrid of the puzzle must have each digit (1 through 9) exactly once.

II. Input Specifications & Output Specifications:
=====================

Each input file will contain multiple Sudoku solutions to check. The input will begin with a single
integer, n, on a line by itself. Following that line will be n sets of 9 lines, each containing 9 spaceseparated
digits. Each of these digits will be in the range of 1 through 9, inclusive. Each set of 9 lines of
9 digits represents one of user's potential Sudoku puzzle solutions.
For each Sudoku solution, print a single line with either the word “YES” or the word “NO” (in all caps,
without the quotes).


IV. Test Cases Folder
====================
Included in this project is a zip folder which contains a few test cases. Each test case a completed puzzle and the solution to it.
